I recently ported my music playlist to a proprietery cloud service and
discovered how broken shuffle is and the ads were getting on my nerves so I did
a lil thing to help with that. 

Prerequisites: 
* MPV: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv

$ mpv --no-video --term-osd-bar --no-resume-playback  --term-title='file: \
${media-title}' --term-playing-msg='file: ${media-title}' --shuffle \
'https://youtube.com/playlist?list='

If you wish, you could use a textfile with youtube links and play it with
'--playlist'  or pass a cookie for private playlists with
'--ytdl-raw-options="cookies=${cookies_file}"'

i.e. to stream from a textfile you can do: $ mpv --no-video --term-osd-bar \
--no-resume-playback  --term-title='file: ${media-title}' \
--term-playing-msg='file: ${media-title}' --shuffle --playlist=lamusique.txt

If you decided to use the latter approach you could benefit from the following: 

to quickly list all videos in a playlist: $ youtube-dl -e -j --flat-playlist \
'https://youtube.com/playlist?list=' \ | cut -d " " -f 8 | awk -F '"' '{print \
$2}' \ | sed 's_^_https://youtube.com/watch?v=_' 1>playlist.txt 2>/dev/null

This will echo all stdout to playlist.txt. I'm no awk ninja but if the file has
gaps remove every other line with this: $ awk 'NR % 2 == 0' playlist.txt >
lamusique.txt
