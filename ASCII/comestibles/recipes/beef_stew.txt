BEEF STEW - LA Times California Cookbook (1981)

[This is a recipe created by the comedian Paul Lynde. I have never actually made 
it since it would be far too much for just the two of us. But I am fascinated 
that all the ingredients are either canned or pre-prepared.]

2 lbs beef stew meat, cubed
1 lb can of diced carrots, drained
1 lb can of small whole onions, drained
1 lb can of whole tomatoes
1 lb can of green peas, drained
1 lb can of cut green beans, drained
1 lb can of small whole potatoes, drained
1/2 can of beef consomme
1/4 cup quick-cooking tapioca
1 Tbls brown sugar
1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs
1 bay leaf
1/3 cup dry white wine
Salt and pepper to taste

Combine ingredients, cover and bake at 250F for 6 to 7 hours. [A large slow 
cooker could work as well.]
