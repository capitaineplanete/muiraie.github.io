   A recipe for "toast sandwiches," from Mrs. Beeton's Dictionary of
   Every-Day Cookery, 1865:

     Ingredients. -- Thin cold toast, thin slices of bread-and-butter,
     pepper and salt to taste. Mode. -- Place a very thin piece of cold
     toast between 2 slices of thin bread-and-butter in the form of a
     sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper and salt. This sandwich may
     be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of
     cold meat, to the toast, and in any of these forms will be found
     very tempting to the appetite of an invalid.

   In 2011 the Royal Society of Chemistry worked out the nutritional
   content:

   3 slices of white bread = 240 Calories. Butter = 10 g = 90 Calories
   Total = 330 Calories
   Toast sandwich nutrients
   Protein = 9.5 g
   Fat = 12 g
   Carbohydrate = 55 g
   Fibre = 4.5 grams
   Calcium = 120 mg
   Iron = 2 mg
   Vitamin A = 90 mcg
   Vitamin B1 = 0.25 mg
   Vitamin B2 = 80 mcg
   Vitamin B3 = 4 mg
   Vitamin D = 0.08 mcg

   "I've tried it and it's surprisingly nice to eat and quite filling,"
   said he RSC's John Emsley. "I would emphasise that toast sandwiches are
   also good at saving you calories as well as money, provided you only
   have one toast sandwich for lunch and nothing else."
