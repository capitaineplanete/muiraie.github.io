STOUP (Stew/Soup)

2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
1 16 oz bag of frozen vegetables for stew
2 16 oz cans of chicken (or vegetable) broth, heated
1 1 oz packet of french (or beefy) onion soup mix
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp thyme

Lightly brown the chicken and garlic in a bit of oil. Remove chicken and cut 
into bite-sized pieces. Return chicken to pot, add other ingredients and bring 
to a simmer. Cover, stirring occasionally, until chicken and vegetables are 
deemed cooked.

NOTES: I use a stew mix with vegetables cut in chunks that includes onions, 
potatoes, celery and carrots without any seasoning. Without the potatoes some 
other starch source might be needed as a thickener. The onion soup mix 
should definitely provide all the salt required. This "recipe" is hardly an 
exact science and is open to all sorts of variations on every ingredient. The 
basic formula, by volume, is:

ONE PART MEAT + ONE PART VEGETABLE + TWO PARTS LIQUID + SEASONINGS = STOUP

This works pretty well as a thickener: Equal parts softened (real) butter and 
flour kneaded together and then whisked completely into the stoup while cooking. 
One or two tablespoons each should be plenty. Adds a nice richness...
