<h2>about this site...</h2>

<p>This site is primarily a repository of plain text files <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">(US-ASCII)</a> that I 
have either written, collected or converted. They are mostly set at a fixed 
column width and may not play nicely with your modern browser or smartphone. All 
files with a <strong>.txt</strong> suffix are US-ASCII. While the site is designed mainly for 
my own use, I am happy to share it. Please feel free to peruse and/or download 
anything you find of interest.</p>

<p>The site is automagically generated in html/css by tree-1.8.0 and is hosted by 
the <a href="https://sdf.org">SDF Public Access UNIX System</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that things around here tend to get added, removed, renamed and/or 
relocated not infrequently so directly linking to an individual file is probably 
not a good idea. Best to download a copy for yourself or request a 
permanent(ish) link.</p>

<p>And any file with my email address at the bottom is something I have scribbled. 
Therefore, if you have questions or comments, you can contact me at:</p>

# FAQ #
#######

Q: What is this website about?

A: For the most part it will be technical guides, reviews, and some news; but there 
will be other things on the occasion.


Q: Why the dated looking site?

A: I value the simplicity of what the web was and could continue to be.


Q: Why is there no SSL/TLS version of the site?

A: I may introduce secure connectivity as an option in the future, but itâ€™s largely 
unnecessary for a static site.


Q: What are you making this site with?

A: Tree and vim. Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented 
listing of files and output is to tty. However, with a bit of tweaking you can produce HTML pages with it.
