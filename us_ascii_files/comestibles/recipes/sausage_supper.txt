If using bulk, shape into patties. Brown sausage over moderate heat. Place onion 
around sausage and cook until tender. Pour off as much fat as possible. Place 
potatoes over and around sausage. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, taking into 
consideration that the sausage is seasoned. Add water, cover and simmer 25
