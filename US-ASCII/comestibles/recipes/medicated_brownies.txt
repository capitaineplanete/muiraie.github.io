Medicated Brownies

[A very easy-to-make cannabis brownie recipe I created for those times when you want an edible, but only have a small amount of herb. This recipe makes 3 brownies, each serving containing 1/3 gram of cannabis.]

1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/8 tsp salt
1 egg
1/2 stick melted quasi-cannabutter
1 tsp vegetable oilÂ 
1 gram cannabis

Simmer 1/2 stick butter with 1 gram finely ground herb on the stove top for 2 hrs. Keep on a low heat to avoid burning. You may even need to periodically turn the stove off to avoid to avoid burning/evaporation. After the canna-butter has been simmering for 1 hour add 1 tsp of vegetable oil to it. Any type of vegetable oil is fine; olive, grapeseed, etc. Continue simmering.

Once the canna-butter/oil has simmered for 2 hrs take off heat and allow to cool. I did not strain the herb out of the butter/oil. It is your choice whether you want to strain or not. 
Mix dry ingredients together in a separate mixing bowl. Add egg and cannabutteroil to the dry mix. Thoroughly mix until a thick, gooey batter is produced.

Pour into a cupcake tin. The amount of batter produced should completely fill 3 standard cupcake moulds. Using a cupcake tin allows you to accurately know how much cannabis is in a single brownie. I recommend using those tin foil cupcake cups to avoid sticking.

Bake on 350 degrees for 25-35 mins. Mine were good after 30 mins, but not every oven is the same.

Let brownies cool. Enjoy.
