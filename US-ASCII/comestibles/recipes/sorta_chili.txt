SORTA CHILI

A non-canonical, apostate chili if you live in Texas...

1 pound lean ground beef
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small sweet onion, diced
1 small green bell pepper, diced

1 8 oz can tomato sauce
1 16 oz can of pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 16 oz can of diced tomatoes, undrained

1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp thyme
1 tsp ground comino (cumin)
1 tsp to 1 Tbsp chili powder, to taste

Brown and crumble beef with garlic, onion and pepper. Drain fat (optional). Add 
canned and dry ingredients. Mix and simmer 1 hour covered, stirring 
occasionally. If necessary, adjust thickness with water, broth or your favorite 
beer, preferably Lone Star.
