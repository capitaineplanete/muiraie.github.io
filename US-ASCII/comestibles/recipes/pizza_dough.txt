Dough recipe #1

500g all purpose flour
340g warm water
10g salt
10g sugar
7g dry active yeast


Combine water sugar and yeast let stand for 10 mins,
combine dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture,
knead for 12 mins.

Oil a large bowl and place the dough in it and roll 
it around to coat in the oil,
let proof for 2 to 11 hours -- the longer the better.

When it's double in size poke the dough to deflate it 
and dump onto well floured surface.
Pat and stretch out dough making sure to leave a ring 
around it for crust to rise and while this is happening 
add pizza stone to bottom rack with oven preheated to 
500 Degrees.

Let it heat up for about half an hour
Cheese is 50 50 blend of a Muenster and mozzarella cheese 

And add whatever toppings you prefer
