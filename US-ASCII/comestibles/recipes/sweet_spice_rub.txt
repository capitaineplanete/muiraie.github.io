SWEET SPICE RUB - Joy of Cooking (2006)

A dry rub is a compatible blend of herbs and/or spices that is rubbed on food 
before grilling, sauteing or roasting. Rub the following on chicken, beef, lamb, 
or pork as well as salmon and bluefish.

Mix well:

1 part sweet paprika
1 part packed brown sugar
1 part ground cumin
1 part black pepper
1 part salt

Although a rub or paste smeared on just before cooking still adds flavor, it's 
best when applied to the food up to 24 hours before cooking so the flavors will 
be more than skin-deep.
